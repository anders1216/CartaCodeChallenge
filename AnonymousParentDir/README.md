Hello Carta!

Thank you for the opportunity to work through your interview process. 

My program is fairly simple and written in Ruby. Although I prefer writing in Javascript I chose Ruby as I am more familiar with it than Node.js and wanted to write a program that runs offline.

To run the program you need to have a relevant version of Ruby installed. 

From the command line navigate to the parent directory and enter the command 

```
ruby run.rb

```

Once you run the file you will be prompted to enter the filepath to the file you wish to convert.

After you enter the filepath for the file you wish to convert you will be asked to enter an optional date parameter (YYYY-MM-DD).

After you enter the date parameter you will be prompted to name your new file.

After you enter a name your file will be created in the progams parent directory.

##Assumptions##
This program assumes that Date parameters will be written in YYYY-MM-DD format. 
This program also assumes each file will be written in the following format INVESTMENT DATE, SHARES PURCHASED, CASH PAID, INVESTOR with each investment constituting one line.
Finally this program assumes that the filepaths for the to-be-convereted files are entered accuratly and either absolute paths or relative to the 'jsonify_csv.rb' file. 

Thank you I look forward to hearing back from you soon!
